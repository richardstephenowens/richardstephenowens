- 👋 Hi, I’m @richardstephenowens
- 👀 I'm currently looking for a C or C++ project that I can contribute to. Probably sporadically.
- 🌱 I'm a specialist in a few ancient languages - CORAL66 in particular. In my day job I also work with a few different ancient architectures at the machine code and assembly level.
